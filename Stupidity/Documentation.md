# How to use Stupidity
This is a scratch plugin made by me (info in README.md)

# 1. Loading the extension
To load the extension, there are multiple options. currently, we would suggest going to the Stupidity.js file, and copying all the text. Will add more on loading in the future.

# 2. Block Functions.
There are multiple functions, and here are how to use them.

UNFINISHED BLOCKS (will be skipped): 'Do funnies with input []', 'inject js []', 'Destroy the website'
1. Text To Case
This block is helpful in general, and is very simple to use.
First, put some text into the block. Next, select which case you would like, uppercase or lowercase. Now it will convert this text into the select case, and will output it.

2. Encode/Decode Text
This one is also simple. You enter the text, and you select the method. there is an encode block and a decode block.
For more info on these encoding and decoding methods, links are at the bottum.

3. Invert colors
This is simple: it just invert the website colors. Running again returns website to normal.

4. Alert Text
Also pretty simple. Input some text, and it will show an alert in your browser when ran.

5. Inject Custom CSS
This one is more complicated. You can do all your normal CSS effects, but here are some basic effects for beginners.
